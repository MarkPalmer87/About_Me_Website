                <h2>Background… Why Programming?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I used to think that programming was something too complicated for me to learn. I thought that you really needed to have a Computer Science degree and have studied for years to understand enough to get anything done. I'm glad I was wrong. I also used to think that 18 was too old to start playing guitar….but I did that anyway too.</li>
                    <li>Today, I'm confident that if I really wanted to, I could do just about anything – become a doctor, lawyer, or programmer. We live in a world where you can learn new things more easily than ever before, there's no shame in pivoting to redirect your life in the direction you want. For me, the programmer's lifestyle is very appealing. I admire that programmers are lifelong learners.</li>
                    <li>After lots of research, and talking with some developer friends of mine, I decided to give a Python bootcamp with NSS a try. I'm really glad I did; I had such a great time, and it was actually really fun and satisfying. I met some new friends and felt validated that I would indeed enjoy programming!</li>
                    <li>From there I felt ready to really jump in and explore the tech field, I did some more research, and landed on studying Software Engineering…</li>
                </ul>
