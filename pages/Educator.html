                <h2>Lessons Learned Teaching in Public Schools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am best suited to work with smaller groups of people. I can handle lots of people, but as an introvert, I will find 
                        myself very drained after a lot of days with lots of people…</li>

                    <li>You can’t keep moving forward at a decent pace if you're stuck trying to get everything perfect.</li>
                    
                    <li>Appreciate where you’re at in life right now! I’m glad to have had my experience as a teacher, but I’m also glad to have 
                        learned enough about myself to work towards a position better suited for my strengths and personality. </li>

                    <li>We all learn things differently. What makes sense to you doesn’t always make sense to someone else. When you're a teacher, 
                        this means that you must get creative and present information in lots of different, engaging ways to reach people. The other 
                        side of that is, as a learner, you need to find out what is most engaging and effective for you. </li>

                    <li>When you teach something to someone, you’ll  come to realize just how much you do, or do not, truly understand that subject.</li>
                    
                    <li>From my years commanding and entertaining the classroom. I am now a proficient and confident public speaker.</li>

                    <li>Teaching is a difficult and undervalued profession. Call or email your favorite teachers and thank them for the impact 
                        they had on your life. There is a soft spot in my heart for teachers, they work too hard for not enough. </li>

                <h2>Background Education & Teaching Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>7th Grade Science teacher at Bailey STEM Magnet Middle School (2013-2014)</li>
                    <li>9th-12th Grade History/Government/Economics Teacher at Cheatham County Central High School (2015-2016)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My background area of study was history, but getting started in education, I opted to take on different subject
                     areas to get my foot in the door as a full-time employed teacher. I took the Praxis exam to attain certifications
                      to teach all core areas of 5th-8th grade. With more opportunities for employment, I soon found myself teaching 
                      7th grade Science.</p>
                <p>In teaching at the middle school level, in a different subject area, I was forced to take on a different perspective,
                     outside my comfort zone, and develop materials that would make sense to a younger audience than I had previously anticipated.  
                     This proved to be difficult, but it made me a better and more prepared teacher.  I learned classroom management and was able 
                     to focus more on teaching than subject materials. </p>
                <p>After getting some professional experience on my resume, I was able to get a full-time position teaching in my subject 
                    area of Secondary History at Cheatham County Central High School in 2015.</p>
