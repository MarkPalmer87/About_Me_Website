                <h2>Appraisal Work Experience</h2>
                <p>Over the years I've completed hundreds if not thousands of appraisals of all sorts all across the middle Tennessee area. During that time I've worked with 3 companies, as well as completed a few assignments independently.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned being an Appraiser</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I know Middle Tennessee like a cabbie knows NYC. I've been everywhere, man.</li>
                    <li>In appraisal, you can do it however you want, as long as you explain everything you did and why. The number one rule for an appraiser is: explain, explain, explain.</li>
                    <li>I've learned how to deal with people in difficult situations. Appraisers are an objective 3rd party, observing the home for the loan company. We have to report what we see, as it is, and can't do anyone any favors. Sometimes this can lead to difficult conversations with
                         homeowners about repairs that must be done or angry calls when a valuation doesn't meet their expectations. I've learned how to address these uncomfortable situations head on, informing the homeowner of everything they need to know. In these difficult situations, I treat everyone how I’d like to be treated.</li>
                    <li>Appraisal work at its core is about understanding and communicating clearly a confident opinion of value. My experience teaching has made me an effective communicator.</li>
                    <li>I am really good at sketching complicated properties!</li>
                    <li>I am well suited for detail-oriented work.</li>

                <h2>Appraiser Responsibilities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A residential Appraiser determines the value of a home, usually for purchase or refinance</li>
                    <li>The appraiser's main duties are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home appraisal inspections – where the square footage of the home, garage, decks/patios and other features will be sketched, photographed and documented.</li>
                            <li>Conducting Market Research & running a thorough comparable sales analysis.</li>
                            <li>Writing and Delivering Appraisal Report</li>

                <h2>Background and Education</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To attain a Certified Residential Appraiser License, you must have a Bachelor's degree or higher, and attain 150 supervised hours of experience, complete the required 200 hours of education courses, then you may apply to take the licensure exam.</li>
                    <li>Part of the application process is defending 3 of your appraisals in an interview with a member of the State Appraisal Licensure Board. After successful completion of this step, you are approved to take the Exam.</li>
                    <li>The Tennessee Certified Residential Appraisal Licensure Exam was the hardest test I've ever taken. It's a 4 hour exam of 125 questions. You are allowed some sheets of paper, pencils, and a HP-12c financial calculator. The exam is completed on a computer screen.</li>
                    <li>I spent the first half hour or so writing memorized formulas all over my sheets of paper. I referred back to them a lot to complete the exam, it is a very math-heavy test.</li>
                    <li>I attained my Certified Residential Appraisal License in April of 2016.</li>
                    <li>In 2018 I was added to the FHA Roster of approved appraisers for the state of Tennessee.</li>
                    <li>I attained my Certified General Appraiser's License in Kentucky in 2024.</li>
                    <li>I was also added to the FHA Roster of approved appraisers for the state of Kentucky in 2024.</li>
                </ul>
