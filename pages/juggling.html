            <h2>Why Juggling?</h2>
        </section>
            <section id="why-juggling-answer" class="mt-4">
            <p>A fair question. For me it was, because it was around and looked fun. I guess it looked like something I thought I could do.
                My brother got a book that came with a set of 3 beanbag balls. He read it and taught himself. I just watched. Just playing around
                with him, I picked it up as well, from there we got more elaborate, doing some passes and other patterns. Then around age 13 one year
                my grandparents gifted me a set of 3 clubs... I messed around with them until I had it down. Once you have the club and ball patterns down,
                pretty much every other medium is possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I do it because I'm ADHD, and its a good way to be moving, and get some energy out in a healthy and meditative way. Juggling has been
                found to help strengthen areas of the brain associated with movement, and reflexes. I find it a helpful because you can always work at some 
                new pattern or movement, and thats a good way to stay motivated to improve, theres always another acheivable goal ahead of you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But most importantly, I juggle because it's fun, it brings joy to me, and the people around me.

                                with balls. Rings are easier, but tricky with wind outside. </p>

                                I was definitely surprised... I didn't ask for them. Hundreds of smashed noses later, I found myself 
                                proficient with clubs! Once you've got the club throw pattern down, knives and torches are just a matter

                                the most difficult skill to master, its never as comfortable as the single medium, but you can sink into it after a bit of
                                practice. The ball through the ring is a classic.
