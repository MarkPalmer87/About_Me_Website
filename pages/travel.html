                    My first time traveling abroad was in high school. I was in the Chinese
                    foreign exchange program, and I, along with 4 other students, spent 2 weeks in China. It was an incredible experience. During my time in China, I was able to use my language skills, and appreciate
                    the culture in a way that I had never even known was possible. Afterwards I knew that I had to see more... 
                    There is a whole other world out there, where everything is different, it gives you a perspective on life, that
                    I think everyone should experience.
